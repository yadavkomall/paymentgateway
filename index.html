            knowing what to expect can help you cope. From basic information about
            cancer and its causes to in-depth information on specific cancer types –
            including risk factors, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment options – you’ll find it here.
            cancer might just be one of the most feared and dreaded diseases. Globally, cancer is responsible
            for the death of nearly 9.5 million people in 2018. It is the second leading cause of death as per the
            world health organization. As per studies, in India, we see 1300 deaths due to cancer every day.<br />
            These statistics are truly astonishing and scary. In the recent few decades, the number of cancer has
            been increasingly on the rise. </b></p>

            collective name given to the disease where certain cells of the person’s body start dividing continuously,
            refusing to stop. These extra cells form when none are needed and they spread into the surrounding tissues
            and can even form malignant tumors.
            Cells may break away from such tumors and go and form tumors in other places of the patient’s body
            As we know, cancer can actually affect any part or organ of the human body<br />.<br /> We all have come
            across various types of cancer – lung, blood, pancreas, stomach, skin, and so many others. Biologically,
            however, cancer can be divided into five types specifically – carcinoma, sarcoma, melanoma, lymphoma,
            leukemia.

            Among these, carcinomas are the most diagnosed type. These cancers originate in organs or glands such as
            lungs, stomach, pancreas, breast, etc. Leukemia is the cancer of the blood, and this does not form any
            tumors. Sarcomas start in the muscles, bones, tissues or other connective tissues of the body. Lymphomas are
            the cancer of the white blood cells, i.e. the lymphocytes.
            And finally, melanoma is when cancer arises in the pigment of the skin.</b></p>

      'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><br />Early diagnosis and immediate medical care in
            cancer are of utmost importance. When diagnosed in the early stages, then the treatment becomes easier and
            has more chances of success. The three most common treatment plans are either surgery, radiation therapy or
            chemotherapy.


            <br />If there is a benign tumor, then surgery is performed to remove the mass from the body, hence removing
            cancer from the body. In radiation therapy,
            we use radiation (rays) to specially target and kill the cancer cells. Chemotherapy is similar, where we
            inject the patient with drugs that target and kill the cancer cells. All treatment plans,
            however, have various side-effects. And aftercare is one of the most important aspects of cancer treatment.

            year. India ranks third in cancer cases after China and the US. This makes cancer the second most common
            cause of death in India. Unfortunately, half a million deaths happen due to the ignorance of the disease and
            inaccessibility to the costly medical treatment. Donate to patients suffering from cancer so that they can
            receive access to medical support like chemotherapy, radiation and quality nutrition. Give them a chance to
            fight.<br />
            <br /> A major cause of lower cancer survival rate in India is the late detection of common cancers, which
            compromises the treatment success by a great margin. Therefore, early screening for common cancers can save
            several lives. On the path of recovery, nutritious food also plays an important role, which many of the poor
            patients could not afford. GiveIndia partner NGOs are providing free/low-cost treatment to poor cancer
            patients. Your small monthly donation can help these nonprofits to save lives by giving them a fair chance
            to fight cancer.</b></p>
